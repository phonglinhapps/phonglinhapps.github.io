To comply with GDPR, we have updated our terms and conditions and privacy policy by updating our processes to ensure your updated rights are protected for the GDPR, ensuring any third party companies, individuals and affiliates we use or act on our behalf are also GDPR compliant, and instructing our staffs on the requirements of GDPR and data privacy procedures.<br/>
